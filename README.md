<p align="center"><b>This is the snap for Steam for Windows</b>. It works on 
Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and other major Linux distributions.<b>This snap is 
experimental, built with development releases of upstream WINE and may not 
function as expected. If you encounter issues please report them is this 
GitHUb project.</b></p>

## Reusing this snap

You can use this snap as a reference for creating snaps of other WINE
compatible 32-bit Windows applications or games. Here are the main
things you'll need to modify:

  * Change the meta data and `apps:` and `parts:` names from `steamforwindows`.
  * Modify the `command:` to reference the executable the application/game should launch.
  * If you can't redistrbute the application/game use `INSTALL_URL:` to reference a web accessible installer.
  * Modify the `install_app()` and `launch_app()` functions in [`snap/scripts/sommelier`](snap/scripts/sommelier) to suit the application/game you're snapping.
  * Modify the `TITLE` and `NOTICE` in [`snap/scripts/sommelier`](snap/scripts/sommelier) to suit the application/game you're snapping.
  * If you can't redistrbute the application/game use `INSTALL_URL:` in the `environment:` of the main `command:` to reference a web accessible installer.
  * Some games require a virtual desktop to function correctly. Add `VIRTDESKTOP: 1` to the `environment:` of the main `command:` to enable virtual desktop or set it to `0` or remove it completely to disable a virtual desktop.
  * Some applications/games require that WINE DLLs are overriden, you can specify then via `DLLOVERRIDES:` in the `environment:` of the main `command:`.
  * If the application/game requires some winetricks to work then you can specify them via `TRICKS:` in the `environment:` of the main `command:`.

Here's an example `environment:` that shows how to use some of the capabilities outlined above:

```
    environment:
      WINEPREFIX: "$SNAP_USER_COMMON/.wine"
      DLLOVERRIDES: "mscoree,mshtml=" # Prevent pop-ups about Wine Mono and Wine Gecko
      TRICKS: "winxp steam"
      LC_ALL: "C.UTF-8"
```

One other point of interest is that `yad` is staged in the snap and a
faux `zenity` script is included that execs `yad`. We do this because
`yad` is argument compatible with `zenity` but pulls far fewer package
dependencies.

If you have any questions about creating snaps of WINE compatible
Windows applications then [post in the Snapcraft forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io).
